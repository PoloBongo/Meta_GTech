**StaySoul** is a video game created during the TAP NATION Game Jam, based on the theme **"Children's Games"**. Inspired by the famous children's game "1, 2, 3, soleil" (also known as "Red Light, Green Light"), StaySoul immerses you in a world where a ghost must traverse a dynamically generated map while avoiding traps and responding to a mysterious countdown.

The objective of the game is simple: move your ghost across the map without getting caught by the end of the countdown. However, beware! Light effects and sound cues will disturb your movements, and you'll need to act quickly and strategically to avoid traps and stay safe.

## Gameplay

In StaySoul, you play as a ghost moving across a map that is generated in real time ahead of you. Each time a light effect is triggered along with a sound, the ghost must **stop immediately**.

- **Countdown:** A countdown is triggered, and you must stop moving before it ends.
- **Light & Sound Cues:** Light effects and sound cues signal when you must stop, similar to "1, 2, 3, soleil." You need to be precise and quick!
- **Traps:** Traps appear on the map from time to time, forcing you to navigate carefully to avoid falling into them.
- **Deceptive Countdown:** Sometimes, the countdown **doesn’t trigger properly**, creating a sense of tension and uncertainty. Stay alert to avoid being tricked.
